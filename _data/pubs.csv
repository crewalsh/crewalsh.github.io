The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has been most widely used for its easy implementation and high sensitivity. However, the BOLD signal is dependent on various anatomical, physiological, and imaging parameters, thus its interpretation with respect to physiological parameters is not straightforward. To understand the physiological source of the BOLD signal, measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes are helpful. In this chapter, we discussed (1) various fMRI techniques, (2) the sources of the BOLD fMRI signals, (3) improvement of BOLD techniques, (4) contrast-to-noise consideration, and (5) spatial and temporal resolution. CBF can be measured using arterial spin labeling MR methods, and CBV change can be detected using a vascular space occupancy-dependent technique. Conventional gradient-echo BOLD fMRI is sensitive to intravascular and extravascular signals of small and large venous vessels, while spin-echo BOLD fMRI is sensitive to intravascular signals of all-sized venous vessels and extravascular signals of small vessels. At high magnetic fields, intravascular signals can be reduced by shortening blood T2 relative to tissue T2. Thus, SE BOLD fMRI at high fields improves spatial specificity. Intrinsic spatial and temporal resolution of hemodynamic-based fMRI techniques is dependent on vascular structures and responses. Using fMRI, submillimeter functional structures can be mapped, and an order of second temporal resolution can be achieved. Overall, fMRI opened a window of basic and clinical neuroscience research.",,10.1007/978-3-031-10909-6_19,,,,education,book_chapter,kim_and_bandettini_2024.md

However, this information can be inaccurate, incomplete or unavailable in multiple scenarios such as resting-state, naturalistic paradigms or clinical conditions. In these cases, blind estimates of neuronal-related activity can be obtained with paradigm-free analysis methods such as hemodynamic deconvolution. Yet, current formulations of the hemodynamic deconvolution problem have three important limitations: 1) their efficacy strongly depends on the appropriate selection of regularization parameters, 2) being univariate, they do not take advantage of the information present across the brain, and 3) they do not provide any measure of statistical certainty associated with each detected event. Here we propose a novel approach that addresses all these limitations. Specifically, we introduce MvME-SPFM (multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping), a novel hemodynamic deconvolution algorithm that operates at the whole brain level and adds spatial information via a mixed-norm regularization term over all voxels. Additionally, MvME-SPFM employs a stability selection procedure that removes the need to select regularization parameters and also lets us obtain an estimate of the true probability of having a neuronal-related BOLD event at each voxel and time-point based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability paths. Besides, the formulation is tailored for multi-echo fMRI acquisitions, which allows us to better isolate fluctuations of BOLD origin on the basis of their linear dependence with Echo Time (TE) and to assign physiologically interpretable units (i.e., changes in the apparent transverse relaxation ) to the resulting deconvolved events. We demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art deconvolution approaches, and shows higher spatial and temporal agreement with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with a standard model-based linear regression approach, even at the level of individual neuronal events. Consequently, the proposed algorithm provides more reliable estimates of neuronal-related activity, here in terms of , for the study of the dynamics of brain activity when no information about the timings of the BOLD events is available. This algorithm will be made publicly available as part of the splora Python package.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523002700,10.1016/j.media.2023.103010,,,,,journal_article,urunuela_et_al_2024.md

Naturalistic fMRI predictors of emergent reading,1/29/24,Neuropsychologia,193,,,,,,"Despite reading being an essential and almost universal skill in the developed world, reading proficiency varies substantially from person to person. To study why, the fMRI field is beginning to turn from single-word or nonword reading tasks to naturalistic stimuli like connected text and listening to stories. To study reading development in children just beginning to read, listening to stories is an appropriate paradigm because speech perception and phonological processing are important for, and are predictors of, reading proficiency. Our study examined the relationship between behavioral reading-related skills and the neural response to listening to stories in the fMRI environment. Functional MRI were gathered in a 3T TIM-Trio scanner. During the fMRI scan, children aged approximately 7 years listened to professionally narrated common short stories and answered comprehension questions following the narration. Analyses of the data used inter-subject correlation (ISC), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Our primary finding is that ISC reveals areas of increased synchrony in both high- and low-performing emergent readers previously implicated in reading ability/disability. Of particular interest are that several previously identified brain regions (medial temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG)) were found to “synchronize” across higher reading ability participants, while lower reading ability participants had idiosyncratic activation patterns in these regions. Additionally, two regions (superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and another portion of ITG) were recruited by all participants, but their specific timecourse of activation depended on reading performance. These analyses support the idea that different brain regions involved in reading follow different developmental trajectories that correlate with reading proficiency on a spectrum rather than the usual dichotomy of poor readers versus strong readers.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839322300297X,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108763,,,,,journal_article,wat_et_al_2024.md

Traditional theories hold that facial viewpoint is represented by view-selective mechanisms at early visual processing stages and that representations become increasingly tolerant to viewpoint changes in higher-level visual areas. Newer theories, based on single-neuron monkey electrophysiological recordings, suggest an additional intermediate processing stage invariant to mirror-symmetric face views. Consistent with traditional theories, human studies combining neuroimaging and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods have provided evidence of view-selectivity in early visual cortex. However, contradictory results have been reported in higher-level visual areas concerning the existence in humans of mirror-symmetrically tuned representations. We believe these results reflect low-level stimulus confounds and data analysis choices. To probe for low-level confounds, we analyzed images from two popular face databases. Analyses of mean image luminance and contrast revealed biases across face views described by even polynomials—i.e., mirror-symmetric. To explain major trends across human neuroimaging studies of viewpoint selectivity, we constructed a network model that incorporates three biological constraints: cortical magnification, convergent feedforward projections, and interhemispheric connections. Given the identified low-level biases, we show that a gradual increase of interhemispheric connections across network layers is sufficient to replicate findings of mirror-symmetry in high-level processing stages, as well as view-tuning in early processing stages. Data analysis decisions—pattern dissimilarity measure and data recentering—accounted for the variable observation of mirror-symmetry in late processing stages. The model provides a unifying explanation of MVPA studies of viewpoint selectivity. We also show how common analysis choices can lead to erroneous conclusions.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/17/e0296232024.abstract,https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0296-23.2024,,https://github.com/toporam/model-crossings,,,journal_article,revsine_et_al_2024.md

These changes in brain function involve increased synchronization between cortical areas 6,7 as well as alterations in sensory processing pathways and networks connecting the thalamus and cortex 5,8–11. Cognitive tasks engage overlapping functional networks with sensory pathways facilitating information processing 12,13, and thalamocortical and corticocortical networks supporting task performance 14,15. Frontoparietal circuits play a crucial role in cognitive tasks 16 and states of decreased consciousness 17. To develop an integrated framework of consciousness and cognition, it is important to understand how fluctuations in alertness and cognitive processing interact in these shared circuits 18. Our hypothesis is that during periods of low alertness, individuals who actively maintain task engagement would recruit additional frontoparietal and sensory processing networks, while thalamocortical dynamics that typically change during sleep onset would remain unaffected. Our findings demonstrated that as alertness decreased, passively listening to auditory tones led to increased synchronization in the parietal lobe, whereas actively performing an auditory task resulted in increased long-range frontoparietal synchronization. During decreasing alertness, passive listening (but not active task engagement) was associated with widespread increased synchronization between the thalamus and cortex. In contrast, active task engagement (but not passive listening) led to increased synchronization between the auditory cortex and the rest of the brain.

(2023) Nature,7/22/23,biorxiv,,,,,,,"Pang et al. (2023) present novel analyses demonstrating that brain dynamics can be understood as resulting from the excitation of geometric modes, derived from the shape of the brain. Notably, they demonstrate that linear combinations of geometric modes can reconstruct patterns of fMRI data more accurately, and with fewer dimensions, than comparable connectivity-derived modes. Equipped with these results, and underpinned by neural field theory, the authors contend that the geometry of the cortical surface provides a more parsimonious explanation of brain activity than structural brain connectivity. This claim runs counter to prevailing theories of information flow in the brain, which emphasize the role of long-distance axonal projections and fasciculated white matter in relaying signals between cortical regions (Honey et al. 2009; Deco et al. 2011; Seguin et al., 2023). While we acknowledge that cortical geometry plays an important role in shaping human brain function, we feel that the presented work falls short of establishing that the brain’s geometry is “a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity” (Pang et al. 2023). Here, we provide 1) a brief critique of the paper’s framing and 2) evidence showing that their methodology lacks specificity to the brain’s orientation and shape. Ultimately, we recognize that the geometric mode approach is a powerful representational framework for brain dynamics analysis, but we also believe that there are key caveats to consider alongside the claims made in the manuscript.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785v1.abstract,https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.20.549785,,https://github.com/faskowit/eigenmodes_nulls,,bold_connectivity_dynamics,journal_article,faskowitz_et_al_2023.md

Meanwhile, emerging techniques for real-time recording of large populations of neurons have revealed compelling fluctuations in neuronal activity across the brain that are obscured by traditional trial averaging. To reconcile these observations, we use wide-field optical mapping to simultaneously record pan-cortical neuronal and hemodynamic activity in awake, spontaneously behaving mice. Some components of observed neuronal activity clearly represent sensory and motor function. However, particularly during quiet rest, strongly fluctuating patterns of activity across diverse brain regions contribute greatly to interregional correlations. Dynamic changes in these correlations coincide with changes in arousal state. Simultaneously acquired hemodynamics depict similar brain-state-dependent correlation shifts.

While it is conventional to present ""only the significant results"" to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, studies should ""highlight"" the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples and extensions of this approach for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and ""digestible"" findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams’ results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative ""highlighting"" approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard ""hiding"" approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice—focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones—can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them.

This approach is very well suited to the study of reading, where narrative is central to natural experience. But since past reading paradigms have primarily presented single words or phrases, the influence of narrative on semantic processing in the brain – and how that influence might change with reading ability – remains largely unexplored. In this study, we presented coherent stories to adolescents and young adults with a wide range of reading abilities. The stories were presented in alternating visual and auditory blocks. We used a dimensional inter-subject correlation analysis to identify regions in which better and worse readers had varying levels of consistency with other readers. This analysis identified a widespread set of brain regions in which activity timecourses were more similar among better readers than among worse readers. These differences were not detected with standard block activation analyses. Worse readers had higher correlation with better readers than with other worse readers, suggesting that the worse readers had “idiosyncratic” responses rather than using a single compensatory mechanism. Close inspection confirmed that these differences were not explained by differences in IQ or motion.
