Kronemer, PhD received a BA in Neuroscience and Philosophy from Ohio Wesleyan University (2012) and then completed a MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University College London (2013). Dr. Kronemer completed his PhD at Yale University supervised by Hal Blumenfeld, MD, PhD (2021). His thesis research utilized innovative multimodal approaches, including fMRI and intracranial EEG to investigate the neural mechanisms of visual consciousness. Dr. Kronemer now serves as a postdoctoral fellow in the Section on Functional Imaging Methods at the National Institute of Mental Health. His current research aims to discriminate between the neural mechanisms for seen versus illusory visual conscious experiences and chart the intrinsic fluctuations in conscious perception with fMRI. Dr. Kronemer is a passionate science educator and outreach advocate. For more information about Dr. Kronemer, please follow this link: [sharifkronemer.com](sharifkronemer.com)."
