bio: "Victoria (Tori) Gobo graduated from Colgate University in May 2022 with a major in neuroscience and a minor in computer science. While an undergraduate, Tori specialized in neuroscience research with an emphasis on computational methods of analysis. Particularly, her thesis project focused on developing a brain-supervised sparse coding network to investigate how the early visual system dynamically changes how it encodes information relative to a task. During Summer 2022, she joined SFIM as a Postbac IRTA to learn more about functional methods in research. Following the conclusion of her fellowship Tori plans on getting her PhD in computational neuroscience."
